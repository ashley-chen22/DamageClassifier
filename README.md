# DamageClassifier

## Overview
Our proposed BuildingGAN works to enhance classification of disaster type and level of building damage. This is done by implementing DisasterGAN locally through cropping out images of the buildings and using these as our inputs.

By doing this we hope to address class imbalances as disaster type is dominated by 'fire' instances with very few 'volcano' and damage level is  dominated by 'no damage' and very few 'damaged.'
